# CustomGeoCoder
This script will get the coordinates of addresses in an excel file and write the coorinates to a file.
I am aware of python libraries built for Geoscoding such as geopy, geocoder, and googlemaps but these sometimes return blank data if the format of the address was invalid, and I wanted to get ALL coordinates of over 40k addresses so I hacked up this code that allowed me to achieve this.

#DEMO
This is a alpha test demonstration, reading addresses from file and print out coordinates.
